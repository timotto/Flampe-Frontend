# Flampe Frontend

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

I added a process function to the options of filerev. The function uses the hash and extension only to make the 
filenames shorter and fit better on the ESP8266 SPIFFS filesystem. 

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
